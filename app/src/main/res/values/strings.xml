    <string name="consent_text" >I work for Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a research organization.  We are currently conducting a study on technology and innovation in firms. The study is conducted jointly with the World Bank and Columbia University.  As you just completed the Survey/ As you completed the survey on 20 October,2021 you are eligible to participate in an exercise. The exercise will help us learn what you expect, for an AVERAGE Footwear/RMG Firm, will change by replacing the clutch motor on one sewing machine with a servo motor. We will begin with questions about your existing sewing machines and then ask you about different scenarios where a clutch motor is replaced by a servo motor. Please keep in mind that we want to understand what you think will be the impact on the AVERAGE footwear/RMG firm. Participating in this exercise will help you earn a maximum of $100. I will go through all the rules with you thoroughly so that your firm has the best chance of acquiring the amount. The process will take about 15 minutes. If you complete the full exercise, you will have a chance of receiving a cash amount in your firm’s Mobile Money Account.</string>


    <string name="instructionsLabel">Instructions</string>
    <string name="instructionsText">“For each of the questions that we will ask you in the exercise, we would like you to imagine that you have 10 matchsticks to allocate to different Number ranges shown on the screen based on the probability that you think a specific event will happen. One matchstick represents 10 percent or a 1 in 10 chance. As you add matchsticks, it means that you think the event is more likely to happen. For example, if you put two matchsticks in a range, it means you think there is a 20 percent chance of this outcome happening (or a 2 in 10 chance of this outcome happening). If you pick 5 matchsticks, it means that you think there is a 50 percent chance (or a 5 in 10 chance) of this outcome happening and if you put all 10 matchsticks in a range, it means you are certain this will be the outcome.\nThere is no right or wrong answer, we just want to know what you think for a Leather Goods or Footwear Firm similar to yours.”\n

I want to go through a practice exercise with you first. This will help you understand the structure of the full exercise. I will go through all the steps in detail. I am happy to go through the information as many times as you need, so please ask me questions at any stage.</string>


    <string name="instructionsText2">You will get a bonus for participating in the game and you will get an additional bonus based on each matchstick you assign in the correct box. The bonus will get reduced based on how many matchsticks you assign in the incorrect boxes.</string>
